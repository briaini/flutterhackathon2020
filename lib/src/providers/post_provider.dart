          'Dramatic bodycam footage has captured a South Carolina deputy saving the life of a newborn baby during a traffic stop. Deputy William Kimbro, of the Berkeley County Sheriff\'s Office, says he was on patrol on June 11 in Summerville when he stopped a car that was speeding. One of the passengers told Kimbro that they were rushing a 12-day-old infant named Ryleigh to the hospital because she had stopped breathing after drinking a bottle. That\'s when the deputy jumped into action and started performing first aid to get the baby breathing again. ',
